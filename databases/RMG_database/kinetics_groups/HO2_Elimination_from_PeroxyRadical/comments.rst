MRH CBS-QB3 calculations for the reaction CH3-CH(OO)-CH=CH2 => CH2=CH-CH=CH2 + HO2

Previous RMG estimate for this reaction was an "Average of average" estimate.  This reaction was of
interest to MRH/MHS because the butanol model was sensitive to CH3-*CH-CH=CHOH => CH2=CH-CH=CHOH + HO2.
The high-p limit kinetics were necessary to estimate a k(T,P) for this PES.  MRH could not find a 
stable TS geometry for the exact reaction.  Instead, I removed the OH group and found
a stable TS for that reaction (the titled reaction for this node).

Reactant: 3 hindered rotors were considered (the -OO, -CH3, and -CH=CH2 torsions)
TS: 0 hindered rotors were considered (MRH attempted to treat the -CH=CH2 torsion as a hindered rotor,
	but with no luck.  The complete 360 degree spin would interfere with the HO2 elimination).
Product: 1 hindered rotor was considered (the -CH=CH2 torsion of 1,3-butadiene)

All external symmetry numbers were set equal to one, with the exception of 1,3-butadience which was set to two.
The k(T) was calculated from 600 - 2000 K, in 200 K intervals, and the fitted Arrhenius expression from CanTherm was:
k(T) = 2.476e+06 * (T/1K)^1.829 * exp(-24.247 kcal/mol / RT) cm3/mol/s.  MRH divided this rate coefficient by
three to account for the reaction path degeneracy, yielding the value stored in the rateLibrary.

MRH approximation for the general R2OO_2H_HDe node

MRH computed the rate coefficient for the reaction CH3-CH(OO)-CH=CH2 => CH2=CH-CH=CH2 + HO2 (see node 845).
The difference between the R2OO_2H_HDe and CH3CH(OO)CHCH2 nodes is defining the delocalized group (in the
case of the CH3CH(OO)CHCH2 node, the -CH=CH2 functional group).  MRH thinks using the kinetics for node 845
in the event node 846 is hit is reasonable, considering this part of the molecule does not play a role in the
TS (and it is certainly better than leaving RMG to estimate via "Average of Average").
