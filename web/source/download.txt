Latest Developer version
------------------------

To get the latest development version of the code (the head of the official master branch) you can use either git or SVN for read-only access:

* git clone git://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Java.git
* svn checkout http://svn.github.com/greengroup/RMG-Java.git

If you might want to make changes, a better idea is to create your own account on github.com, fork the official repository (http://github.com/greengroup/RMG-Java/fork), and clone that. There's help at http://help.github.com/
