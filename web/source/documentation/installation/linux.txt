Compiling from source
-----------------------

To install RMG on a Linux computer:  

1. Create the directory in which you want to install RMG. For the purposes of this document, we will set the directory to :file:`/usr/local/rmg`. Depending on where you choose to install RMG, you may need superuser privileges. ::

    $ mkdir /usr/local/rmg

2. Set the RMG environment variable as the directory created in the first step. In a bash shell you would type, for our example, ::
    
    $ export RMG=/usr/local/rmg

  In a C shell you would type, for our example, ::
    
    $ setenv RMG /usr/local/rmg

  To avoid typing this line each time, append it to your :file:`~/.bashrc` (bash shell) or :file:`~/.cshrc` (C shell) file.

3. Obtain the source code (See :ref:`download`). Download the file :file:`rmg-3.2-linux-i386.tar.gz` or :file:`rmg-3.2-source.tar.gz`, ungzip and untar it, and move its contents to the :file:`$RMG` directory. ::

    $ tar -xvzf rmg-3.2-source.tar.gz
    $ mv rmg3/* $RMG

Step 4 is only required if you are working with the source package. Binary packages are available for several platforms and will already contain the compiled executables.

4. Compile the programs. If you are working with the source package, you will need to compile RMG and its supporting Fortran programs. To do this, change to the directory :file:`$RMG` and execute the makefile. The make script will compile four programs: fame, frankie, DASSL, and GATPFit. It will then call the ant build script to compile RMG itself. ::

    $ cd $RMG
    $ make
    
  If you only wish to compile the RMG Java code, you can do so by typing::

    $ cd $RMG
    $ ant jar

At this stage you will have a functional version of RMG. The remaining steps are only required to enable some advanced features.



The next few steps are required only if you want RMG to be able to generate InChIs for the species present in the reaction mechanism.

5. Download the InChI version 1 (software version 1.01) source code and Application Program Interface (API).

6.  Change to the :file:`InChI-1-API/cInChI/gcc_makefile` directory and execute the makefile.  Copy the resulting executable :file:`cInChI-1.exe` to the :file:`$RMG/bin` folder. ::

    $ cd InChI-1-API/cInChI/gcc_makefile
    $ make
    $ cp cInChI-1 $RMG/bin
    
You are now ready to generate InChIs in RMG.
