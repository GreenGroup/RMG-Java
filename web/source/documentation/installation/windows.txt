*************************
Installing on Windows
*************************

You can find the installer package or source files on the `Downloading RMG
<downloading.html>`_\ page.  


Installer Package (Easiest Method)
===================================

1. Download the windows installer .exe file from the `Downloading RMG
<downloading.html>`_\ page.  

2. Open the .exe executable file.  When prompted to install to a folder, we suggest keeping the installation folder set
to the default ``C:\RMG-Java\`` or installing to a directory not under ``C:\Program Files\`` in order to avoid complications 
with administrative access in Windows.

3. You are now ready to use RMG by clicking on the RMG-gui icon.  You can also use RMG through the command prompt.   
For more information on how to run RMG, see the `documentation
<../index.html>`_\ page.  






.. _compiling_from_source:

Compiling from Source
=========================

To get the source files, see the `Downloading RMG <downloading.html>`_\ page.  

To build a functional version of RMG from source you will need to do the following:

1. Install the following prerequisite programs:

Java SE Development Kit (JDK), version 6.
    Install the program, available from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp.

G95 Fortran Compiler
    Install the free g95 compiler, available from http://www.g95.org/
	
Apache Ant.
    This controls the generation of Java executables.
    Obtain from http://ant.apache.org/.   Unzip binary distribution into folder of choice.

2. Create the directory in which you want to install RMG. We recommend avoiding the `C:\Program Files\` directory to avoid complications
with admnistrative access in Windows during the installation.  
 
3. Set environment variables for ``RMG``, ``JAVA_HOME``, and ``ANT_HOME``, using the installation directories for each, respectively.   To set environment variables in windows:
   * Go to ``Start --> Control Panel --> System`` (may need to switch to Classic Control Panel view). Click on the ``Advanced`` tab, then click on ``Environment Variables``.

   * In the lower half of the ``Environment Variables`` window for System variables, click ``New``.

   * In the ``New System Variable`` window, in the ``Variable`` name field, type the environment variable name (i.e. ``JAVA_HOME``). In the ``Variable`` value field, type the directory in which it was installed.

   * Click OK twice to confirm the change.
   
   
3.  Edit the path.  To do so  
   * Go to ``Start --> Control Panel --> System`` (may need to switch to Classic Control Panel view). Click on the ``Advanced`` tab, then click on ``Environment Variables``.

   * In the upper half of the ``Environment Variables`` window for User variables, select ``PATH`` and then click the ``Edit`` button.

   * Add ``%ANT_HOME%\bin`` to the variable value field after your other paths, separating them with a ``;``.  
   
   * Click OK twice to confirm the change.

4. Obtain the source code (See :ref:`installation_downloading`), decompress the zip file, and move its contents to the :file:`%RMG%` directory you created in step 2.

5. Download Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) and Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK) DLL files from https://github.com/GreenGroup/RMG-Java/downloads.  Create a subdirectory under the main `%RMG%` installation directory called `bin`.  Move `blas.dll` and `lapack.dll` to this subdirectory.

6. Compile the programs. The easiest way to do the latter is to execute the file :file:`make.bat` in the :file:`%RMG%` directory through the command prompt. The batch script does not compile the RMG source; for this you will need ant.  
After the batch script is done running, type ``ant jar`` into the command prompt to compile the RMG source.  At the end of installation the screen should display ``BUILD SUCCESSFUL``.

7.  You are now ready to use RMG.  To install advanced (optional) features, see the `optional features <optional.html>`_\ page.  



RMG Viewer/Editor (RMGVE) 
---------------------------

The RMGVE is an accompanying software which can be used for viewing
the database of RMG and also the models generated by RMG.  The RMGVE is
present along with RMG in the :file:`$RMG/RMGVE` directory and need not be
downloaded separately. To run the RMGVE just go to the :file:`$RMG/RMGVE`
directory and execute ``RMGVE 20080101.bat`` on the command
line.  The RMGVE directly reads the RMG database :file:`$RMG/database/RMG_database` which includes the thermo data and the kinetics data.
Please refer to :ref:`Using the RMGVE <modification>` to see how to modify the RMG database.



InChI
-------------------
The next few steps are required only if you want RMG to be able to generate InChIs for the species present in the reaction mechanism.
   
Download the InChI version 1 (software version 1.01) source code and Application Program Interface (API) from `IUPAC <http://www.iupac.org/inchi/download/index.html>`_ and unzip the file. Navigate to the :file:`InChI-1-API\\cInChI\\vc6_project\\Release` folder. Copy the executable file :file:`cInChI-1.exe` and paste it in the :file:`"%rmg%"\\bin` folder.
    
You are now ready to generate InChIs in RMG.




   
   
.. To perform sensitivity analysis on the models generated, you will also need:

.. * **The Large Scale Differential Algebraic Equation Solver with Sensitivity Analysis (DASPK), version 3.1.** DASPK 3.1 is *subject to copyright restrictions*, but available for research purposes from http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~cse/software.html.
.. * **The Differential Algebraic Equation PACKage (DAEPACK) library file.** This can be obtained with the JACOBIAN software, which can be obtained at no cost for registered acadamic users from http://www.numericatech.com/academia.htm.
