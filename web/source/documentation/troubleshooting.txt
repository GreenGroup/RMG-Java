Known issues
============

Results differ from machine to machine.
---------------------------------------

The ODE solver (DASSL) will return slightly different results depending on the
Fortran compiler, the compilation options, the machine architecture, etc. This
is not a mistake, as all the results will be within the requested precision
(:ref:`ATOL and RTOL <atol-rtol>`). However, in instances where two reaction
fluxes have similar or identical rates, the small difference can lead to a
different decision being made regarding which species to add to the core or
which pressure-dependent network to explore next.

Results differ from run to run.
-------------------------------

If you run the same input file twice on the same computer, the resulting
chemistry should be the same. However, when a species with several isomers is
created there is no guarantee that they will be numbered the same way.
Therefore the species numbers (and hence names) will differ from run to run.
This will make the log files and chemkin files look different.


Job freezes for a long time while running Fame.
-----------------------------------------------

Sometimes a pressure-dependent network calculation in Fame can have a very
large output. When this output stretches to tens of megabytes, sometimes it
can block the pipe through which the Fame program (written in Fortran) and the
RMG program (in Java) communicate. When the computer is running low on memory
this can be especially troublesome. On some computers the job has been known
to freeze for tens of hours. The only sure way to avoid this is to build a
smaller model: use a higher termination criterion.

Troubleshooting
===============

*****Final attempt (#36) on species ____ failed.
------------------------------------------------

With QMTP: if after "Final attempt" it still fails, and reports the chemgraph of the species that failed,
take this chemgraph and either provide thermochemistry for it in a primaryThermoLibrary, or else
add it to your ForbiddenStructures section of your condition file or database.
