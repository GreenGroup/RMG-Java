*******************
Representing oxygen
*******************

When constructing a mechanism that involves molecular oxygen, 
**represent ground state oxygen as the single-bonded triplet form,**
:math:`^3\Delta^-_g`::

  (1) O2 0.1 (mol/cm3)
  1 O 1 {2,S}
  2 O 1 {1,S}

The traditional double-bonded Lewis dot structure representation of oxygen::

  (1) O2 0.1 (mol/cm3)
  1 O 0 {2,D}
  2 O 0 {1,D}

now
represents the more stable of the singlet states, :math:`\mbox{}^1\Sigma_g`;
the other singlet state, :math:`^1\Sigma^+_g`, is not considered by RMG.

Conversion between singlet and triplet forms is possible through the primary
reaction library OxygenSingTrip; the reactions involved are very slow, however,
and are likely to be absent from any mechanisms generated. At this point, no other
reactions of singlet oxygen have been included in RMG.

Previous versions of RMG databases were ambiguous as to the treatment of
oxygen, with both ChemGraphs above representing ground-state oxygen. The
database provided with RMG 3.2 has been modified to make all of the
oxygen-related chemistry that was present in RMG databases consistent with the
single-bonded biradical representation.

Again, **please represent ground-state oxygen as a single-bonded biradical species**::

  (1) O2 0.1 (mol/cm3)
  1 O 1 {2,S}
  2 O 1 {1,S}
