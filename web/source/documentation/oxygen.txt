Representing oxygen
*******************

When constructing a mechanism that involves molecular oxygen, **please
represent ground state oxygen as the single-bonded triplet form,**
:math:`^3\Delta^-_g`. Note that this is a departure from previous versions of
RMG.::

  (1) O2 0.1 (mol/cm3)
  1 O 1 {2,S}
  2 O 1 {1,S}

The traditional double-bonded Lewis dot structure representation of oxygen now
represents the more stable of the singlet states, :math:`\mbox{}^1\Sigma_g`;
the other singlet state, :math:`^1\Sigma^+_g`, is not considered by RMG.::

  (1) O2 0.1 (mol/cm3)
  1 O 0 {2,D}
  2 O 0 {1,D}

Previous versions of RMG were ambiguous as to the treatment of oxygen, with
both ChemGraphs above representing ground-state oxygen. While this modification
has not been fully tested, we believe that it accurately includes and makes
consistent all of the oxygen-related chemistry that was present in RMG
databases.

Conversion between singlet and triplet forms is possible through the primary
reaction library OxygenSingTrip; the reactions involved are very slow, however,
and are likely to be absent from any mechanisms generated. At this point, no
reactions of singlet oxygen have been included in RMG.

Again, **please represent ground-state oxygen as a single-bonded biradical species**.
