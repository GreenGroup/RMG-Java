2010-MM-DD: RMG 3.2 Released!
==============================
RMG version 3.2 has been released. The new release includes a number of improvements and bug fixes, including the following:

Features:

- The :file:`RMG_Database` folder has been restructured more logically. (:ref:`PrimaryReactionLibrary <primaryreactionlibrary>` and :ref:`Seed Mechanism <seedmechanism>` specifications in condition files will need updating)

- More accurate thermodynamic quantities from PM3 calculations for cyclic species based on explicit 3D molecule geometries (provided the user has access to GAUSSIAN03 or MOPAC2009)

- New reaction model pruning option to reduce number of edge species and ease memory limitations.

- New non-negativity option for DASSL simulations. This offers a new way of dealing with NegativeConcentrationException cases.

- New reaction family, 1,2-Birad_to_alkene, for interconversion of alkene (triplet) biradicals and singlet alkenes

- It is possible to specify :ref:`forbidden structures <forbiddenstructures>` in the input file.

- Various error messages have been improved to give more helpful information to the user.

- Dictionary.txt will now be written at every iteration, rather than just the final iteration.

- RMG output file includes timestamp and code revision information.

Bug fixes and performance improvements:

- Refinements to values in the database based on literature review.

- Automatic escape from infinite loop.

- Addressed issues that could lead to trying to simulate and empty reaction model in pressure-dependent cases.

- Fixed IWORK/RWORK renaming on Linux platforms.

- Fixed bug producing unneccessary error message (when using AUTO option) suggesting that the ODE solver failed when an edge flux exceeds user-specified tolerances at t=0.

- Fixed DASPK issues, including variables.dat renaming for multiple reaction systems, ability to use constant concentration, reaction flux evaluation for Lindemann reactions, and sensitivity coefficient calculation.

- Improved robustness for "frankie".

- Changed ODE Solver input file writing to use BufferedWriter to ease memory usage issues when using AUTO with large reaction models.

- Fixed a bug in counting pressure-dependent edge reactions with the AUTO method.

- Fixed calculation of Cp(T=0) and Cp(T=Infinity) for monoatomic and linear species.

- Addressed collider issues, including an ArrayOutOfBoundsException associated with colliders and a collider identification issue.

- Addressed infinite recursion error in getToEndOfAxis that could occur with cyclic cumulenic species.

- Fixed syntax for helium thermochemistry in CHEMKIN input file written by RMG.

2009-08-05: RMG 3.1 Released!
==============================
RMG version 3.1 has been released. The new release includes a number of improvements and bug fixes, including the following:

- :ref:`PrimaryReactionLibrary <primaryreactionlibrary>` and :ref:`PrimaryThermoLibrary <primarythermolibrary>`  now both behave as reference libraries from which data are taken (in preference to group additivity estimates), when and if the data are needed.

- :ref:`Seed Mechanism <seedmechanism>` allows the mechanism building to start from a seed mechanism, which is included in its entirety before the simulation starts. (This is how :ref:`PrimaryReactionLibrary <primaryreactionlibrary>` behaved in previous releases.)

- New databases: GRIMech 3.0 (PrIMe recommended) thermodynamic and kinetic values are included

- Support for Chemkin's P-Log format for :ref:`k(T,P) reporting <pressuredependence>`  (in addition to Chebyshev format).

- Added additional options for the input file, including:

    - User-specified limits for number of carbon / oxygen / radical per species
 
    - User-specified Chebyshev fitting options

- Changed many dependent Fortran codes to use standard input and output, rather than writing temporary files to disk.

- Reduced run-to-run variations by standardizing the order of averaging of values in the kinetics trees.

- Corrected inconsistencies in edge flux evaluation for pressure-dependent reactions.

- Corrected an error in inert gas normalization for runs with multiple temperatures/pressures

- Fixed DASPK interface

- Fixed bugs in peroxide (ROOR) frequency estimation

- Fixed a bug in the gauche correction database for alkenes

- Fixed issues with duplicate reactions and with Chebyshev fitting in writing CHEMKIN input files

- More frequent garbage collection

Special thanks to Dr. Seyed-Abdolreza Seyed-Reihani and Jeffrey Mo for identifying many of the bugs.

2009-03-05: RMG 3.0 Released!
==============================
After nearly two years of development, the RMG team is proud to present the release of RMG version 3.0. New features include:

- Cocurrent generation of a reaction mechanism over multiple temperature and pressure conditions

- Automatic time and conversion stepping when no intermediate points specified

- A new open-source module for handling pressure-dependent reaction networks

- On-the-fly generation of InChI strings for species

- A new graphical user interface for easier RMG input file generation

- Updated RMG Viewer and Editor (RMGVE), including database editing tools

- Thermodynamics estimates for non-cyclic species incorporate certain steric effects (1,5-interactions and gauche interactions)

- Simplified Windows installation

Also including a number of bug fixes, RMG 3.0 is a marked improvement over RMG 2. Find out how to `download RMG <download.html>`_\ .

2007-03-25: RMG 2 Release
==============================
RMG 2 has been released. The source code of the software, the manual, and sample initialization files are provided with this release.
