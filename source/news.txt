2009-xx-yy: RMG 3.1 Released!
==============================
RMG version 3.1 has been released. The new release includes a number of improvements and bug fixes, including the following:

- :ref:`PrimaryReactionLibrary <primaryreactionlibrary>` and :ref:`PrimaryThermoLibrary <primarythermolibrary>`  now both behave as reference libraries from which data are taken (in preference to group additivity estimates), when and if the data are needed.

- :ref:`Seed Mechanism <seedmechanism>` allows the mechanism building to start from a seed mechanism, which is included in its entirety before the simulation starts. (This is how :ref:`PrimaryReactionLibrary <primaryreactionlibrary>` behaved in previous releases.)

- New databases: GRIMech 3.0 and PrIMe-recommended thermodynamic values are included

- Support for Chemkin's P-Log format for :ref:`k(T,P) reporting <pressuredependence>`  (in addition to Chebyshev format).

- Added additional options for the input file, including:

    - User-specified limits for number of carbon / oxygen / radical per species
 
    - User-specified Chebyshev fitting options

- Changed many dependent Fortran codes to use standard input and output, rather than writing temporary files to disk.

- Reduced run-to-run variations by standardizing the order of averaging of values in the kinetics trees.

- Corrected inconsistencies in edge flux evaluation for pressure-dependent reactions.

- Corrected an error in inert gas normalization for runs with multiple temperatures/pressures

- Fixed DASPK interface

- Fixed bugs in peroxide (ROOR) frequency estimation

- Fixed a bug in the gauche correction database for alkenes

- Fixed issues with duplicate reactions and with Chebyshev fitting in writing CHEMKIN input files

- More frequent garbage collection

Special thanks to Dr. Seyed-Abdolreza Seyed-Reihani and Jeffrey Mo for identifying many of the bugs.

2009-03-05: RMG 3.0 Released!
==============================
After nearly two years of development, the RMG team is proud to present the release of RMG version 3.0. New features include:

- Cocurrent generation of a reaction mechanism over multiple temperature and pressure conditions

- Automatic time and conversion stepping when no intermediate points specified

- A new open-source module for handling pressure-dependent reaction networks

- On-the-fly generation of InChI strings for species

- A new graphical user interface for easier RMG input file generation

- Updated RMG Viewer and Editor (RMGVE), including database editing tools

- Thermodynamics estimates for non-cyclic species incorporate certain steric effects (1,5-interactions and gauche interactions)

- Simplified Windows installation

Also including a number of bug fixes, RMG 3.0 is a marked improvement over RMG 2. Find out how to `download RMG <download.html>`_\ .

2007-03-25: RMG 2 Release
==============================
RMG 2 has been released. The source code of the software, the manual, and sample initialization files are provided with this release.
