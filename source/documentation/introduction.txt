Introduction to RMG
*******************

RMG is an automatic chemical reaction mechanism generator that constructs 
mechanisms composed of elementary chemical reaction steps using a general understanding of how hydrocarbons react. The model parameters (rate constants 
and reaction thermodynamics) are estimated using a database and the idea that the 
behavior of functional groups is somewhat independent of the molecule(s) containing them. The RMG database consists of two parts: kinetic rate rules and 
thermodynamic group additivity values. 

RMG is an object-oriented program written in Java, which provides a stable, 
robust programming architecture that is easily extended, modified, and improved. 
At its core, RMG relies on two fundamental data structures: graphs and trees. The 
graphs represent the chemical structures, and the trees represent the databases of 
thermodynamic and kinetic data. Currently, RMG can generate reaction mechanisms for species involving carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and its mechanisms 
can contain many hundreds of species and tens of thousands of reactions. It is 
also capable of performing first-order sensitivity analysis on the rate constants 
and species thermodynamics. 

RMG was originally developed by Dr. Jing Song under the guidance of Prof. William 
Green in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the `Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology <http://web.mit.edu/>`_. Currently the principal developer of RMG is Sandeep Sharma, a graduate student in Prof. William Green's research group.

Changes
-------

Changes made in RMG 3.0 include the following:

New features:

- Pressure-dependent reaction network generation

- InChI generation

- Graphical user interface for input file generation

- Generation of reaction mechanisms for multiple reaction conditions (T,P)

- Automatic time stepping option

- Updated RMG Viewer and Editor (including database editing tools)

Functionality changes:

- On the first step of mechanism generation, only one species is added, rather than adding all edge species

- Thermodynamics estimates for non-cyclic species incorporate certain steric effects (1,5-interactions and gauche interactions)

Bug fixes:

- Fixed bug in symmetry number generation (previously could be underestimated in certain cases)

- Fixed differential equations to correctly treat cases where total number of moles changes
