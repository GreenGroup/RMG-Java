How to generate these docs, using Python
===========================================
This documentation is generated using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ so that is the place to look for documentation of syntax etc.
These instructions are specific to RMG and the Green Group, and describe how to run Sphinx on a shared computer and how to get the documentation source.

On a linux computer such as Rainier
***********************************
These instructions should get you up and running on a shared computer such as Rainier or Monch without needing a superuser password or anything.
A bonus side-effect will be that you have the Easy Install package set up correctly, so you can easily get and install other python packages. 
See http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall or http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools for more details.

Get the python distribution utils running 
------------------------------------------

1. Create a file ``.pydistutils.cfg`` in your home directory

It should contain the following::

 [install]
 install_lib = ~/lib/python
 # This next line directs EasyInstall
 # and the distutils to install scripts in the user's "bin" directory.
 install_scripts = ~/bin

2. Run the command ``export PYTHONPATH=$HOME'/lib/python/'`` and also add it to your :file:`.bashrc` file for next time you log in.

#. Create the folders ``bin``, ``lib`` and ``lib/python`` in your home directory

#. Download the EasyInstall bootstrap script from http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py  to ``~/lib``

#. Change into ``~/lib`` and run ``$ python ez_setup.py``


Get and install sphinx
----------------------
#. Type ``easy_install sphinx``

Yes, it's that easy.

Get the source from CVS
-----------------------
#. Set up your CVS root by typing ``export CVSROOT=:ext:username@monch.mit.edu:/home/cvs`` 
   replacing ``username`` with your username
#. In a sensible location, type ``cvs co RMG_manual``

Compile the documentation
-------------------------
#. Inside the ``RMG_manual`` directory type one of the following:

  * ``make html`` to generate the html web pages
  * ``make latex`` to generate the latex source (then follow the instructions to build it to pdf)
  * ``make upload`` to upload the html and pdf to your (own) athena web space such as http://web.mit.edu/rwest/www/RMG/


On a Windows computer
**********************

Installing Python on Windows
-----------------------------

1. Python for Windows may be obtained from
   http://www.python.org/download/. Although the site lists versions
   upto Python 3.0, not all of these have the easy_install package
   available yet. For the moment, I would recommend Python 2.5.4

2. Visit http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools. Download and
   install the ``setuptools`` executable for your Python version(2.5).

3. Go to the Environmen Variables settings in Windows(``Control
   Panel-->System-->Advanced System Settings``)  and add the address of
   the ``Scripts`` folder in the Python directory to the variable
   ``Path`` under System Variables. Typically this will be someting
   like ``C:\Python25\Scripts``
  

Installing Sphinx
-----------------

1. Visit http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx and download the
   Sphinx.egg file for your Python version. Save it in an easily
   accesible folder.


2. Open a command prompt. Type and run ``easy_install <path to the
   Sphinx.egg file>``


Running Sphinx
-------------- 
1. Running Sphinx requires you to specify a source directory and a
   build directory. For our uses, the source directory would be the one
   containing all the .txt files of the RMG documentation.

#. The build directory is where all the compiled html pages are
   stored. The location can be chosen as per your convenience.

#. Open a Command Prompt and type ``sphinx-build -b html <path to   
   source directory> <path to build directory>``. You can now view the
   html pages created in the build directory which can then be uploaded
   etc.


#. Please refer to http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html for details

Mathematics!
*************

Instructions are at http://sphinx.pocoo.org/latest/ext/math.html
At the moment the :file:`conf.py` is set up to use the ``sphinx.ext.pngmath`` extension, which means you will need to have both :math:`\textrm{\LaTeX}` and `dvipng <http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/dvipng/>`_ installed. We may be able to switch to ``sphinx.ext.jsmath`` - give it a go.
