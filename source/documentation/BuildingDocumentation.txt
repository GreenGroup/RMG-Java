How generate these docs, using Python
========================================
This documentation is generated using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ so that is the place to look for documentation of syntax etc.
These instructions are specific to RMG and the Green Group, and describe how to run Sphinx on a shared computer and how to get the documentation source.

On a linux computer such as Rainier
***********************************
These instructions should get you up and running on a shared computer such as Rainier or Monch without needing a superuser password or anything.
A bonus side-effect will be that you have the Easy Install package set up correctly, so you can easily get and install other python packages. 
See http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall or http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools for more details.

Get the python distribution utils running 
------------------------------------------

1. Create a file ``.pydistutils.cfg`` in your home directory

It should contain the following::

 [install]
 install_lib = ~/lib/python
 # This next line directs EasyInstall
 # and the distutils to install scripts in the user's "bin" directory.
 install_scripts = ~/bin

2. Run the command ``export PYTHONPATH=$HOME'/lib/python/'`` and also add it to your .bashrc file for next time you log in.

#. Create the folders ``bin``, ``lib`` and ``lib/python`` in your home directory

#. Download the EasyInstall bootstrap script from http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py  to ``~/lib``

#. Change into ``~/lib`` and run ``$ python ez_setup.py``


Get and install sphinx
----------------------
#. Type ``easy_install sphinx``

Yes, it's that easy.

Get the source from CVS
-----------------------
#. Set up your CVS root by typing ``export CVSROOT=:ext:username@monch.mit.edu:/home/cvs`` 
   replacing ``username`` with your username
#. In a sensible location, type ``cvs co RMG_manual``

Compile the documentation
-------------------------
#. Inside the ``RMG_manual`` directory type one of the following:

  * ``make html`` to generate the html web pages
  * ``make latex`` to generate the latex source (then follow the instructions to build it to pdf)
  * ``make upload`` to upload the html and pdf to your (own) athena web space such as http://web.mit.edu/rwest/www/RMG/


On a Windows computer

I believe Amrit has managed to do this, and will put helpful comments here!

Mathematics!
*************

Instructions are at http://sphinx.pocoo.org/latest/ext/math.html
At the moment the :file:'`conf.py` is set up to use the ``sphinx.ext.pngmath`` extension, which means you will need to have both :math:`\textrm{\LaTeX}` and `dvipng <http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/dvipng/>`_ installed. We may be able to switch to ``sphinx.ext.jsmath`` - give it a go.
