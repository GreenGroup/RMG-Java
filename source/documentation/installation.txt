Installing RMG
==============


.. _installrequirements:

Installation and License Requirements
-------------------------------------

RMG is intended to be an open source program, available to the general public
free of charge. Currently, that is not the case. RMG does require that the user
obtain a license for some of RMG's dependencies, and **it is the user's
responsibility to ensure these licenses have been obtained**.

To install RMG, you will need:

#. The JAVA 2 Platform, Standard Edition.  ---
   `<http://java.sun.com/j2se/index.jsp>`_

#. The DASPK3.1 solver package, which is available for research purposes but
   subject to copywrite restrictions.  ---  `<http://www.engineering.ucsb.edu/
   cse/software.html>`_


.. _linuxinstallation:

Linux Installation
------------------

To install RMG on a linux computer:   SANDEEP:  Are you going to create a
makefile?  How do we deal with compiling DASPK once it has been untarred?

#. Create the directory in which you want to install RMG. ---  ``$ mkdir <dir>``
   ---  For the purposes of this document, we will set the directory to: ---   ``$
   mkdir /usr/share/RMG``

#. Set the RMG environment variable as the directory created in the first step:
   ---  ``$ RMG="<dir>"``  ---  In our example, you would code:  ``$
   RMG="/usr/share/RMG"``

#. Download the ``RMG.tar``, untar it, and move it to the $RMG directory: ---
   ``$ tar -xvf RMG.tar``  ---  ``$ mv RMG/* $RMG``

#. Before running RMG, a shared library file has to be generated which RMG will
   use to perform numerical integration.  Currently RMG uses DASPK3.0 (see Section
   :ref:`installrequirements`).  Copy the file ``daskpk31.tgz`` to the directory
   ``"$RMG/lib"`` and untar it. ---  ``$ tar -zxvf daspk31.tgz``  ---  NOW WHAT?!

#. If you want to rum RMG from the bash shell, use your preferred editor and add
   the following lines to your ``.bashrc`` file:  ---  ``RMG="<dir>"`` (e.g.
   ``RMG="/usr/share/RMG"`` ) ---  ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$RMG/lib``


.. _windowsinstallation:

Windows Installation
--------------------

To install RMG on a Windows computer, unzip the ``RMG.zip`` file to a directory
of your choice (e.g. ``C://Programs/RMG``). ---  Once RMG is unzipped, you will
need to create the ``daspk.dll`` library.  The file ``daspk.dll`` can be created
using either Compaq Visual Fortran or Microsoft Visual C++.  ---   is the
following valid only for MS Visual C++?  Should we drop the CV Fortran?

#. Create a new empty Win32 Dynamic-Link Library project called daspk.

#. Go to project $-->$ add to project $-->$ files.

#. Add the following DASPK files (located in the DASPK3.0 directory): ---

   ``adf_dummy.f``  ``daux.f``   ``dbanpre.f``   ``ddaspk.f``  ``dilupre.f``
   ``dlinpk.f``   ``drbdpre.f``   ``drbgpre.f``  ``dsensd.f``  ``dsparsk.f``
   ``mpi_dummy.f``

#. Add the following C++ files (located in the /RMG/software/CPlusWrapper
   directory): ---  ``cdaspk.h``  ``cdaspk.cpp``   ``JDASPK.cpp``
   ``jing_rxnSys_JDASPK.h`` ``parameter.h``  ``parameter.cpp``   ``reaction.h``
   ``reaction.cpp``

#. Go to Build $-->$ Build ``daspk.dll``

#. Move ``daspk.dll`` to the ``RMG/software/rmg`` directory.
