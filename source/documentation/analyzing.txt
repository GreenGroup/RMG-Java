Analyzing the Output
====================

RMG Output Files
----------------

RMG will generate several types of output files, each with a different purpose.
For linux users, these files will be located in the same directory which
contains the condition file; for Windows users, the output files are located in
the directory ``RMG/software/RMG/``. Generally, there are five outputs from RMG:

#. ``output.txt``.  This is a large file that shows the many steps RMG went
   through to build the model, including the addition of each new species,
   concentrations and fluxes at all of the reported integration time steps, and
   generally the details as RMG builds the mechanism. It is useful for debugging if
   a problem occurs, but other output files are better if all you care about is the
   final model and its behavior. This file also lists the input file at the
   beginning. ---

#. ``Final_Model.txt``.  As its name would imply, this file contains the details
   of the final model created by RMG. It gives the total number of reactions and
   both the species in the model (core) and in the model's edge (those species
   whose flux was not high enough to be included in the model). It also gives all
   of the reactions included in the model, but does not list the species directly.
   If you want the species list, see the Chemkin file or the dictionary file
   (described below). After the list of reactions, the concentration and mole
   fraction profiles of each species are listed, based on the time step provided in
   the input file. This data can easily be pasted into a spreadsheeting program for
   analysis and plotting. If sensitivity information was requested, it would also
   be displayed in this file. ---

#. ``chem.inp`` and ``therm.dat`` (located in ``./chemkin``).  These are the
   Chemkin model and thermodynamic data input files of the model. The file
   ``chem.inp`` lists the elements, species, reactions, and thermodynamic data
   (without |N2|, Ar, or Ne) for the model. The full list of thermodynamic data
   (with |N2|, Ar, or Ne) can be found in ``therm.dat``. ---

.. |N2| replace:: N\ :sub:`2`\ 

#. ``RMG_Dictionary.txt``.  This file lists all the species by name that are
   used in the model, as well as their adjacency list; if InChI generation is turned
   on, the file will also contain the InChI representation for each molecule.  Consequently, it will allow
   to user to see a graphical representation of all species in the model. Typically
   the user will copy this file to an appropriate directory so that it can be read
   by Chemgreen (See Section :ref:`view chemgreen` for further details). ---

#. Restart files (located in ``./Restart/``).  As mentioned in Section
   :ref:`restart`, these five files are used if the job needs to be restarted.  The
   user does not ever need to interact with these files directly, but they do list
   more details than any of the other output files. The five files are:
   ``coreSpecies.txt``, ``coreReactions.txt``, ``edgeSpecies.txt``,
   ``allSpecies.txt`` and ``all Reactions.txt``. The file ``coreSpecies.txt`` lists
   the identification name/number for all species in the core model,
   ``edgeSpecies.txt`` lists the edge species identification name/number, and
   ``allSpecies.txt`` lists both the identification name/number and the structural
   data for all species in both the core and edge. The reaction files are similar
   except they list reaction data. ---


.. _viewchemgreen:

Viewing the Species in the RMG Viewer/Editor (RMGVE)
----------------------------------------------------

When RMG has finished, it will create a file ``RMG_Dictionary.txt`` in the same
directory as the ``condition.txt`` file. This file contains a list of all the
core species (usually the edge species are too numerous to be of use); the core
species can be viewed easily using ChemGreen. To view the core species, rename
the first part of the file (this step isn't strictly necessary, but it is
convenient and a good practice). The file must still end in
"``_Dictionary.txt``" (e.g. ``newname_Dictionary.txt``) for the RMGVE to read
it. Next, copy this file to the directory ``/$ChemGreen/.../thermo``. Once the
file is in the thermo directory, double-click on the ``RMGVE 20080101.bat`` file to
launch the program. Please note that you must close and relaunch the program
every time you add a new file to the thermo directory. Once ChemGreen has
launched, doubleclick on the folder ``Thermo``. Your new file should appear in
this directory (e.g. newname without the "``_Dictionary.txt``"). ---

A new window should appear with a list of names. Highlight any name and click
"view" to see its structure.
