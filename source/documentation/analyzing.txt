Analyzing the Output
====================


.. _rmgoutput:

RMG Output Files
----------------

RMG will generate several types of output files, each with a different purpose.
For linux users, these files will be located in the same directory which
contains the condition file; for Windows users, the output files are located in
the ``%rmg%`` directory. Generally, there are four outputs from RMG:

#. ``output.txt``.  This is a large file that shows the many steps RMG went
   through to build the model, including the addition of each new species,
   concentrations and fluxes at all of the reported integration time steps, and
   generally the details as RMG builds the mechanism. It is useful for debugging if
   a problem occurs, but other output files are better if all you care about is the
   final model and its behavior. This file also lists the input file at the
   beginning.

#. ``Final_Model.txt``.  As its name would imply, this file contains the details of the final model created by RMG.   
   This file reports the concentration and mole fraction profiles of all "core" species, based on the time step information 
   (the "TimeStep" or "Conversions" field) provided in the ``condition.txt`` file.  This data can easily be pasted into a 
   spreadsheeting program for analysis and plotting.
   
   The next set of information contained in the file is a list of all reactions included in the model, along with the modified Arrhenius parameters
   used for each reaction.  For information on where these Arrhenius parameters came from (i.e. which reaction family),
   consult the ``chem.inp`` file.  This set of data may also be pasted into a spreadsheeting program easily.  A negative flux 
   means the reverse reaction (as written) was dominant.
   
   The last set of information is the total running time.  If sensitivity information was requested, it would also appear in this file.

#. ``chem.inp`` (located in ``$RMG/chemkin``).  This file contains the CHEMKIN model and associated thermodynamic data. The file
   lists the elements, species, thermodynamics data (in NASA-7 polynomial form), and reactions (without N2, Ar, or Ne) for the model. 

#. ``RMG_Dictionary.txt``.  This file lists all the species by name that are
   used in the model, as well as their adjacency list; if the :ref:`InChI generation feature <InChIgeneration>` is turned
   on, the file will also contain the InChI representation for each molecule.  This file allows
   the user to see a graphical representation of all species in the model. Typically
   the user will copy this file to an appropriate directory so that it can be read
   by the RMGVE (See Section :ref:`view rmgve` for further details).

Viewing the Species in the RMG Viewer/Editor (RMGVE)
----------------------------------------------------

When RMG has finished, it will create a file ``RMG_Dictionary.txt`` in the same
directory as the ``condition.txt`` file; for Windows users, the ``RMG_Dictionary.txt`` file will be
located in the ``%rmg%`` directory.  This file contains a list of all the
core species (usually the edge species are too numerous to be of use); the core
species can be viewed easily using the RMGVE. To view the core species, rename
the first part of the file (this step isn't strictly necessary, but it is
convenient and a good practice). The file must still end in
"``_Dictionary.txt``" (e.g. ``newname_Dictionary.txt``) for the RMGVE to read
it. Next, copy this file to the directory ``/database/RMG_database/thermo``. Once the
file is in the ``thermo`` directory, double-click on the ``RMGVE 20080101.bat`` file to
launch the program. Please note that you must close and relaunch the program
every time you add a new file to the ``thermo`` directory. Once the RMGVE has
launched, double-click on the folder ``Thermo``. Your new file should appear in
this directory (e.g. newname without the "``_Dictionary.txt``").  Push the "Read family" button and
a new window should appear with a list of names. Highlight any name and click
"View" to see its structure.
