**********************************
Estimating Species Thermochemistry
**********************************

The `Thermo` utility produces group additivity‐based thermochemistry estimates without running RMG. As with the thermochemistry estimates used by RMG, the `Thermo` utility bases its estimates on group values located in the RMG database.

Instructions for Use
--------------------

1. Create a text file named thermo_input.txt in the directory `$RMG/source/rmg/` (the same directory as `RMG.class`, `Thermo.class`, etc.); in the text file, create the adjacency list corresponding to the molecule of interest using the same syntax used to define a species in the condition.txt input file (see RMG manual). Hydrogens can be omitted for simplicity. For example, the adjacency list for 2,2,4,4‐tetramethylpentane could be written as::

	1 C 0 {2,S}
	2 C 0 {1,S} {3,S} {4,S} {5,S}
	3 C 0 {2,S}
	4 C 0 {2,S}
	5 C 0 {2,S} {6,S}
	6 C 0 {5,S} {7,S} {8,S} {9,S}
	7 C 0 {6,S}
	8 C 0 {6,S}
	9 C 0 {6,S}

2. At the command prompt, change directory to the location with Thermo.class and thermo_input.txt ($RMG/source/rmg/). Execute the command ::

	$ java Thermo

  To have output written to file instead of to the screen, use the syntax ::

	$ java Thermo > filename.txt

  where filename.txt is the name of the file to be written.

3. The program will read RMG’s thermodynamics database, count groups, and output the NASA polynomials in CHEMKIN format, as well as another set of values labeled ThermoData. The format for ThermoData is

	ΔH\ :sub:`f,298` S\ :sub:`298` C\ :sub:`p,300` C\ :sub:`p,300` C\ :sub:`p,400` C\ :sub:`p,600` C\ :sub:`p,800` C\ :sub:`p,1000` C\ :sub:`p,1500`

  Units are kcal/mol for ΔH\ :sub:`f,298` and cal/mol‐K for the other quantities (entropy and heat capacity). The symmetry number (including contributions from internal rotations) will also be displayed.
