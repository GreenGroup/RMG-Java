Running RMG from the Command Line in Linux
==========================================

This section assumes that RMG is already installed according to the directions
in Section :ref:`linux installation`. Additionally, it is assumed that you have
created a directory (either in your home directory or elsewhere) in which the
initialization file :file:`condition.txt` has been placed. In the example, we
assume that we have created a directory :file:`/hexane_pyro`, which contains the
condition file :file:`hexane_pyro.txt`.

#. Change the current working directory to the directory with the condition
   file::

    $ cd /hexane_pyro/

#. Run the following Java command to launch the program 
   (all one line)::

    $ java -Xmx500m -classpath $RMG/software/RMG RMG hexane_pyro.txt > output &
  
When RMG is started, it creates ten subdirectories in the directory containing the condition file: :file:`therfit`, :file:`chemkin`, :file:`fame`, :file:`chemdis`, :file:`fit3p`, :file:`frankie`, 
:file:`GATPFit`, :file:`ODESolver`, :file:`InChI` and :file:`Restart`.

In this example, all of the output from RMG is piped to a file output. The ``> output`` 
part of the command is optional but recommended. Please note that the
Java option ``-Xmx500m`` is hardware specific. In this example, we assume that
we can allot five hundred megabytes of memory for Java Virtual Machine running
RMG; please consult a guide to Java for more information. To see the content of
the output file as it is being generated, use the command:  ``$ tail -f output``.


.. _runninginwindows:

Running RMG from the Command Line in Windows
============================================

To run RMG in Windows: Open a DOS-prompt, change the current working directory to the directory with the condition file, and run the following Java command to launch the program.  In this example, the condition file is located in a (new) folder named conditionFiles::

	cd "%rmg%"\conditionFiles
	java -Xmx500m -jar "%rmg%"\software\rmg\RMG.jar condition.txt
	
.. note::

	The name of the input file does not have to be :file:`condition.txt`
