Running RMG
===========


.. _runninginlinux:

Running RMG from the Command Line in Linux
------------------------------------------

This section assumes that RMG is already installed according to the directions
in Section :ref:`linux installation`. Additionally, it is assumed that you have
created a directory (either in your home directory or elsewhere) in which the
initialization file ``condition. txt`` has been placed. In the example, we
assume that we have created a directory ``/hexane_pyro``, which contains the
condition file ``hexane_pyro.txt``.

#. Change the current working directory to the directory with the condition
   file::

    $ cd /hexane_pyro/

#. Run the following Java command to launch the program 
   (all one line)::

    $ java -Xmx500m -classpath $RMG/software/RMG RMG hexane_pyro.txt > output &
  
When RMG is started, it creates eight subdirectories in the directory containing the condition file: ``chemkin``, ``fame``, ``fit3p``, ``frankie``, 
``GATPfit``, ``InChI`` and ``Restart``.

In this example, all of the output from RMG is piped to a file output. The ``> output`` 
part of the command is optional but recommended. Please note that the
Java option ``-Xmx500m`` is hardware specific. In this example, we assume that
we can allot five hundred megabytes of memory for Java Virtual Machine running
RMG; please consult a guide to Java for more information. To see the content of
the output file as it is being generated, use the command:  ``$ tail -f output``.


.. _runninginwindows:

Running RMG from the Command Line in Windows
--------------------------------------------

Running RMG in Windows is a little different than under linux. The most
important difference is the location and name of the condition file. In the
Windows version of RMG, there is a condition directory in the RMG directory:
``RMG/condition``. The ``condition.txt`` file must be placed inside this
directory, and it must have the title ``condition.txt``.

To run RMG in Windows:

#. Place the new ``condition.txt`` in ``RMG/condition``

#. Open a DOS-prompt

#. Change directories to ``RMG/software/rmg``

#. Type ``run``
