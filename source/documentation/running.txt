Running RMG from the Command Line in Linux
==========================================

This section assumes that RMG is already installed according to the directions
in Section :ref:`linux installation`. Additionally, it is assumed that you have
created a directory (either in your home directory or elsewhere) in which the
initialization file :file:`condition.txt` has been placed. In the example, we
assume that we have created a directory :file:`/hexane_pyro`, which contains the
condition file :file:`hexane_pyro.txt`.

#. Change the current working directory to the directory with the condition
   file::

    $ cd /hexane_pyro/

#. Run the following Java command to launch the program 
   (all one line)::

    $ java -Xmx500m -classpath $RMG/software/RMG RMG hexane_pyro.txt > output &
  
When RMG is started, it creates ten subdirectories in the directory containing the condition file: :file:`therfit`, :file:`chemkin`, :file:`fame`, :file:`chemdis`, :file:`fit3p`, :file:`frankie`, 
:file:`GATPFit`, :file:`ODESolver`, :file:`InChI` and :file:`Restart`.

In this example, all of the output from RMG is piped to a file output. The ``> output`` 
part of the command is optional but recommended. Please note that the
Java option ``-Xmx500m`` is hardware specific. In this example, we assume that
we can allot five hundred megabytes of memory for Java Virtual Machine running
RMG; please consult a guide to Java for more information. To see the content of
the output file as it is being generated, use the command:  ``$ tail -f output``.


.. _runninginwindows:

Running RMG from the Command Line in Windows
============================================

To run RMG in Windows: Open a DOS-prompt, change to the RMG directory, and pass the name & location of the :file:`condition.txt` file to RMG::

	cd "%rmg%"
	java -Xmx500m RMG condition.txt
	
.. note::

	The name of the input file does not have to be :file:`condition.txt`
