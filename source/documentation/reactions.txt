**********************************************
Identifying all Reactions for a Set of Species
**********************************************

The ``PopulateReactions`` module accepts a list of species as input (in the form
of adjacency lists) and outputs a list of all possible reactions between those
species, according to the RMG reaction family templates
(located at ``%rmg%\databases\RMG_database\kinetics``)

Instructions for Use
--------------------

1. Create a text file in any directory that you like (for the purposes of this 
example, we'll create a file named :file:`reactions_input.txt`).

At the top of the text file, state the temperature of interest.  When the module
identifies a reaction, it must also grab the kinetics (in the form of modified
Arrhenius parameters).  In some cases, the RMG kinetics library has multiple kinetics
values for the same reaction (e.g. one set valid from 300-500K and another valid
from 700-900K).  Thus, in order to report the best kinetics, the input file must 
contain a temperature::

	Temperature: 1200 (K)

The next item to supply to the text file is the Solvation field.  **This feature of
RMG is still under construction.**  For now, please label the Solvation field "off"::

	Solvation: off 

The next item in the text file are the species of interest.  For each species
of interest, supply a name and an adjacency list.  The adjacency list should
have the same syntax used to define a species 
in the :file:`condition.txt` input file (see RMG manual). Hydrogens can be 
omitted for simplicity. For example, the adjacency list for 1-butanol and
oxygen could be written as::
  
  	nBuOH
	1 C 0 {2,S}
	2 C 0 {1,S} {3,S}
	3 C 0 {2,S} {4,S}
	4 C 0 {3,S} {5,S}
	5 O 0 {4,S}
	
	O2
	1 O 0 {2,D}
	2 O 0 {1,D}

Thus, the total :file:`reactions_input.txt` file looks like::

	Temperature: 1200 (K)
	Solvation: off 
	
  	nBuOH
	1 C 0 {2,S}
	2 C 0 {1,S} {3,S}
	3 C 0 {2,S} {4,S}
	4 C 0 {3,S} {5,S}
	5 O 0 {4,S}
	
	O2
	1 O 0 {2,D}
	2 O 0 {1,D}

2. At the command prompt, change to the directory containing the 
:file:`reactions_input.txt` file and then execute the command ::

	java -classpath "%rmg%"\software\rmg\RMG.jar PopulateReactions reactions_input.txt

For linux users::

	java -classpath $RMG\software\rmg\RMG.jar PopulateReactions reactions_input.txt

To have the output written to file instead of to the screen, use the syntax ::

	java -classpath "%rmg%"\software\rmg\RMG.jar PopulateReactions reactions_input.txt > reactions_output.txt

where ``reactions_output.txt`` is the name of the file to be written.

3. Every time a species is found in the input file, the module will:

	* Read in the name and adjacency list of the species
	* Attempt to react the just-read-in species against each of the reaction 
	  families located in the ``%rmg%\databases\RMG_database\kinetics`` directory
	* Store the results

The reaction families the module will attempt to react the just-read-in species against are either unimolecular or bimolecular.

	* If the reaction family is unimolecular, the module attempts to react the current species
	* If the reaction family is bimolecular (e.g. A+B-->products), the module 
	  assigns the just-read-in species as A and iterates over all previously read-in 
	  species (including the just-read-in species) when assigning B.  The module 
	  then assigns the just-read-in species as B and iterates over all previous 
	  species for A.

All reactions generated are reported in the :file:`PopRxnsOutput_Rxns.txt` file.
The top of the file displays:

	* The units for the modified Arrhenius parameters reported
	* The temperature used in searching for the best kinetics
	* Whether the reported Arrhenius parameters are for gas-phase or solution-phase
	  chemistry

Each line after this has the following format (in general):

	B+C-->D+F	A	n	Ea	Rxn_family exact/estimate:	Node1	Node2
	
where:
	
	- A, n, and Ea are the modified Arrhenius parameters
	- Rxn_family is the reaction family template used to generate this reaction.  
	  The "Rxn_family" is a folder in the ``%rmg%\databases\RMG_database\kinetics``
	  directory 
	- Node1/Node2 are the reactive subgroups of the species that RMG identified
	- exact/estimate states whether the Rxn_family folder's :file:`rateLibrary.txt`
	  file contained data for the Node1-Node2 combination.  If so, the kinetics
	  reported are found, exactly as written, in the file.  If not, an averaging
	  scheme was performed to arrive at the reported numbers.

The identities of B, C, D, and F are located in the :file:`PopRxnsOutput_Spcs.txt` 
file, in the form of adjacency lists.
