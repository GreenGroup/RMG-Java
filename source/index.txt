**********************************
RMG - Reaction Mechanism Generator
**********************************

**Welcome to the RMG home page!**

RMG is an automatic chemical reaction mechanism generator that constructs 
mechanisms composed of elementary chemical reaction steps using a general understanding of how hydrocarbons react.

The main RMG code is written in Java. A number of computationally intensive tasks have been written in Fortran.

RMG is free, open-source software available under the terms of the `MIT/X11 License <license.html>`_\ . The software is developed in the William H. Green research group in the Department of Chemical Engineering at MIT.

If you are new to RMG, please see `this page <newusers.html>`_\ .

News and Updates
----------------

**2009-03-04: RMG 3.0 Released!**

After nearly two years of development, the RMG team is proud to present the release of RMG version 3.0. New features include:

- Cocurrent generation of a reaction mechanism over multiple temperature and pressure conditions

- Automatic time and conversion stepping when no intermediate points specified

- A new open-source module for handling pressure-dependent reaction networks

- On-the-fly generation of InChI strings for species

- A new graphical user interface for easier RMG input file generation

- Updated RMG Viewer and Editor (RMGVE), including database editing tools

- Thermodynamics estimates for non-cyclic species incorporate certain steric effects (1,5-interactions and gauche interactions)

Also including a number of bug fixes, RMG 3.0 is a marked improvement over RMG 2.0. You can find information about downloading RMG `here <download.html>`_\ .

**2007-03-25: RMG 2.0 Release**

RMG 2.0 has been released. The source code of the software, the manual and sample initialization files are provided with this release.
